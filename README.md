Your #1 FTP (File Transfer Protocol) program made by Jared Scarito! JFTP was made with a few key
concepts in mind. I needed to be able to upload files continuously to my raspberry pi's server
as quick as I created new releases of my programs and/or applications. I needed a way in which
files could easily be constantly updated remotely using FTP. So I thought, why not make my own?
Thus, JFTP was born!
